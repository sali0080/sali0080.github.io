        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is <b>Kaline Marie Salibi,</b> I was born and raised in <em>Ottawa, Canada</em>. My favourite colour is blue as you can tell in my title. Other than my Canadian Citizenship, I also have Lebanese Citizenship. I have wonderful parents named Marie and Ghassan, as well as my older sister named Nicole. I had the privilege to be able to travel every year with my family to a different destination everytime. For this upcoming year we decided to plan a <em>Europe</em> trip for 15 days, where we'll be visiting <em>France, Italy and Spain.</em>

            I gratuated high school back in June 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2018 from <abbr title="Franco-Cite">F-C</abbr>. I wasn't sure what I wanted to as my post-secondary education so I told myself I would take only one year gap but turned into 5 years. I still had the opportunity to work for many wonderful large companies as a operations and departemnt manager for many eyars Nike and H&M which.

            I once read a wise quote which stuck with me for a long time and got me through some tuff times.
            <blockquote>
                I'm not saying I'm gonna change the world, but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world <cite>- Tupac Shakur</cite>
